# Learning-Java

* Java programming practice and projects! 

* Basic Java Code Template: 
```
  class Main {
       public static void main (String [] args){
         System.out.print("Hello World");
       }
  }
```
## Hashing & Hash Tables

* Hashing is a technique used to map data (keys) to a fixed-size value using a hash function. This value is typically used as an index in an array for fast data access.
A hash table is a data structure that stores key–value pairs and uses hashing to achieve average-case O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

* How it Works :
A hash function converts a key into an array index.
The value is stored at that index in the hash table.
When searching, the same hash function is used to find the index again.

* Collisions :
A collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash index. Common collision-handling techniques include:
Chaining (storing multiple values in a list at the same index)
Open Addressing (finding another empty slot using probing)

* Key Points :
Fast access compared to arrays and linked lists,
Performance depends on a good hash function,
Widely used in databases, caches, and dictionaries/maps.

## Sorting Algorithms

* This repository provides implementations of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort, focusing on clarity and fundamental algorithmic concepts.

## Time & Space Complexity

Selection Sort

* Best Case: O(n²)

* Average Case: O(n²)

* Worst Case: O(n²)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

Bubble Sort

* Best Case: O(n)

* Average Case: O(n²)

* Worst Case: O(n²)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

Insertion Sort

* Best Case: O(n)

* Average Case: O(n²)

* Worst Case: O(n²)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

Merge Sort

* Best Case: O(n log n)

* Average Case: O(n log n)

* Worst Case: O(n log n)

* Space Complexity: O(n)

Quick Sort

* Best Case: O(n log n)

* Average Case: O(n log n)

* Worst Case: O(n²)

* Space Complexity: O(log n)

Searching Algorithm
* Linear Search :
  ```
  LinearSearch(A, n, key)
    for i ← 0 to n - 1 do
        if A[i] = key then
            return i      // element found at index i
        end if
    end for
    return -1             // element not found
  ```
* Binary Search : 
  ```
  BinarySearch(array, target):
    low ← 0
    high ← length(array) - 1

    while low ≤ high:
        mid ← low + (high - low) / 2

        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid

        else if array[mid] < target:
            low ← mid + 1

        else:
            high ← mid - 1

    return -1   // target not found
  ```
# Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of writing code that works like real life. Instead of thinking only in steps or instructions, you think in terms of things (objects) that have properties and can do actions.

* Four pillars of Object Oriented Programming :
